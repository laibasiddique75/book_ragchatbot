# Why Physical AI?

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional digital artificial intelligence to embodied intelligence that interacts with the physical world. This approach aims to bridge the gap between digital brain processing and physical body interaction.

## Key Concepts

- Embodied cognition: Intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment
- Sensorimotor learning: Learning through physical interaction with the world
- Real-world complexity: Adapting AI systems to handle unstructured, dynamic environments

## Applications

- Humanoid robotics
- Autonomous systems
- Digital twins for robotics
- Simulation-to-reality transfer learning

This foundational understanding sets the stage for developing intelligent systems that can operate effectively in our physical world.
