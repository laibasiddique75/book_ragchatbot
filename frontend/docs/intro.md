# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Bridging the Digital Brain and the Physical Body

Welcome to the comprehensive course on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This curriculum is designed to take you from foundational concepts to advanced implementations in embodied artificial intelligence.

## Course Overview

This course combines theoretical understanding with practical applications, focusing on:

- **Embodied Intelligence**: How AI systems can interact with the physical world
- **Robot Operating System (ROS)**: Framework for developing robotic applications
- **Digital Twins**: Simulated environments for robotics development
- **AI-Robot Integration**: Connecting large language models and AI systems with robotic hardware
- **Humanoid Platforms**: Specialized approaches for bipedal robot control

## Learning Path

The material is organized chronologically to follow a typical semester-long course:

1. **Week 1-2**: Fundamentals of Physical AI and setup
2. **Weeks 3-5**: ROS 2 fundamentals and basic robotic operations
3. **Weeks 6-8**: Digital twin environments and simulation
4. **Weeks 9-11**: Advanced AI integration with NVIDIA Isaac™
5. **Weeks 12-15**: Vision-language-action models and human-robot interaction

## Getting Started

Begin with the "Introduction to Physical AI" section to establish the foundational concepts that will be built upon throughout the course.
